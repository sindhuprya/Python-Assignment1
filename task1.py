# Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

# Take two numbers as input from the user
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Perform basic mathematical operations
addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
division = num1 / num2

# Display the results
